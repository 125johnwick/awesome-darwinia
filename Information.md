# MetaCrab
## **Project description**
MetaCrab is a virtual 3D world on the Crab Network.
By connecting their wallet, users will be able to immerse themselves in a completely new, interesting, interactive world where everything is someone's property in the form of NFTs (land, houses, decorations, banner ads, etc.)

Being at an early stage, the project can already show users some features:
- Explore the world
- Look at your MetaCrab NFTs.
