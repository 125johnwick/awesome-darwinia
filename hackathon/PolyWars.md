# PolyWars (Crab Online Hackathon)

## **Project description**
PolyWars is a Play-to-Earn MMO game involving NFT spaceships and its in-game token $RESS. Compete with other players to loot RESS, level up your planet's mining and mint the rarest battleship. Every action in the game is a transaction on the blockchain, and all the game data is stored in smart contracts.
The RESS token can be created only by playing the game. Planets mine RESS, which can be looted by other players, or secured to be transferred to a wallet as an ERC20. Ships can be minted as ERC721 NFTs by burning RESS, and are assigned random attributes, determining their overall attack, defense, rarity, and appearance.
